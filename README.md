# AduFind

---

## What is this?

This is a lost & found system project for the subject 'Database Management System' at Adamson University. Its purpose is to digitalize the current lost & found system of AdU for improved convenience, accuracy, and scalability.

The project's layout is primarily designed for mobile usage, as it is mostly accessed while at school, using a mobile device rather than a laptop or desktop.

The one uploaded here on GitHub is currently only the frontend of the project because that's what I handled. The backend was made by my groupmates, which include their local database server that we don't know how to remotely connect to yet.
